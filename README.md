# SoftDevWithScriptingLanguages_Ceng445
Projects for Ceng 445, Software Development With Scripting Languages

In this project, we have created an application which shuffles multiple choice exams and outputs in LaTeX. We had several phases for writing this project. We have used python, jQuery, Ajax and Django/Djongo for implementation.

Phase1 - Writing required functions and the logic for the rest of the application

Phase2 - A terminal based server and client application

Phase3 - Static web application for exam, question and booklet shuffling

Phase4 - A dynamic web application, like in the phase 3.
